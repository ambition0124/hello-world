# hello-world
My first depository on GitHub


I am on my way to learn java and the fascinating world of programming.
I want to become the person who can provide solution for the problems which impacts lives of many in this world. 

I want to propose some changes to the current note.
Beside providing solution for major challenges in this world, i also want to deepen my knowledge in this field as well since the computer and humankind are getting closer day by day and i want to be involved, understand and participate on the challenge. 

Cheers
BJ
